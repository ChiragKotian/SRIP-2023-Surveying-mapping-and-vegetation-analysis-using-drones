# Surveying, mapping and vegetation analysis using drones:
This project was one of the projects I was working on while doing an Internship under the program SRIP-2023 at HCR lab, IIT Gandhinagar under the guidance of Prof. Vineet Vashista and PhD guide, Pratik Prajapati.

## Abstract: 
Surveying and mapping is the process of collecting information on physical features of the Earthâ€™s surface, which are used to create maps and models by analysing and creating
 representations and depictions of it. These techniques have been deployed in various
 applications, including urban planning, infrastructure development, environmental
 monitoring, flood modelling and risk assessment. In agriculture, periodically accessing
 parameters such as crop health, soil fertility, water availability, etc., are important to be
 regulated. In this context, surveying and mapping provide an easy and useful technique to
 evaluate these parameters for maximising agricultural yield.

Over the time, mapping and survey methods have evolved significantly. It started with simple
 tools like compasses and chains used to measure azimuth and distances. Progressively,
 instruments such as transits and optical theodolites were used to measure azimuth and vertical
 angles; and tapes and other electronic distance-measuring instruments with relatively good
 accuracies were used. Currently, advanced technologies like satellite remote sensing systems,
 Global Positioning System (GPS) and Robotic Total Station (RTS) instruments are utilised to
 perform large-scale mapping of the areas
. From being a tool of interest to a relatively
 narrow group of surveyors and instrument designers, the use of photography in surveying and
 mapping to determine measurements between objects, i.e., photogrammetry, moved into the
 mainstream during World Wars. Especially during World War 2, as the truly global nature of
 the conflict necessitated a huge investment in resources to create the mapping needed to
 support military operations
. Structure from Motion (SfM)
 technology in digital
 photogrammetry enables the extraction of detailed geometric and visual information to create
 3D structures from images. Modern advancements in computation power have enabled the
 generation of dense 3D geometric information from real-world objects by combining two
 slightly different images to do precise measurements and land mapping.
 
This study aims to explore the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, such as drones, for surveying
 and mapping purposes. A custom-built drone equipped with an integrated GoPro camera is
 designed to capture images at predefined geo-locations. As a case study, multiple images of
 ravine areas and vegetable farms were collected. In order to extract useful information from
 these images, various softwares have been explored. Amongst them, Pix4D emerged as the
 standard tool to provide accurate results, which comes with the disadvantage of being very
 expensive. To overcome this problem, open-source software, such as Meshroom, was also
 explored, whose results were good, albeit with slightly reduced accuracy. The generated 3D
 models of the ravine are used to compute area and volume for the prediction of water flow
 and soil erosion. Moreover, to address the challenges of vegetation analysis, we investigated
 cost-effective alternatives by leveraging RGB images. Through a comparative analysis of the
 red, green, and blue channels, we successfully identified areas covered with vegetation,
 providing valuable insights without the need for expensive multi-spectrum imaging.
